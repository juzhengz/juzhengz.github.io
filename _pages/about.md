I am a 1st-year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu), working with [Prof. Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/).
I am interested in various topics within machine learning, with a particular emphasis on large-scale models, focusing on enhancing their scalability, efficiency, and applicability to complex real-world tasks.
Before joining UMD, I graduated with honors from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.

I'm always open to internship opportunities or research collaborations ‚Äì feel free to reach out! ü§ù
