I am a 1st-year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu), working with [Prof. Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/). I am interested in various topics within machine learning, with a particular emphasis on large-scale models, focusing on enhancing their efficiency, scalability, and applicability to complex real-world tasks.

Prior to joining UMD, I graduated with honors from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), earning a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Information Engineering. I also had the privilege of working with [Dr. Yatao Bian](https://yataobian.com/) at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com) and [Prof. Quanming Yao](https://lars-group.github.io/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I focused on multi-modal large language models and graph neural networks.
